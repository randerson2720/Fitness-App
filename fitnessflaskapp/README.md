# Final Project Assignment

## Requirements

For your final project, you will create a website that uses Flask to access a MySQL database. Your project should include the following:

1. A SQL script that contains
    - a physical implementation for your database (database, tables, constraints, **indexes**)
    - statements that inserts sample data into your database
    - statements that create a user and grants appropriate access to the user.  This user will access the database in your Flask programs.

2. A Flask application that:
    - uses the libraries from the class example.  Applications that use another MySQL library such as SQLAlchemy will not be accepted.
    - displays an overview of the relevant data, excluding data that isn’t relevant to a user, such as autonumber keys
    - allow users to add, update and delete data in safe manner (prevent SQL injection attacks). 
    - includes any additional web pages that you feel would be useful, for example, a welcome page
